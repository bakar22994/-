<p>My name is Aboubakar Diallo. I am Harlem-raised of Fulani African descent, an avid 
appreciator of sports, music, and fashion, and I am also a junior at Hunter College
with a concentration of General Media Studies. I am merely a novice in digital design,
have never built a website, and lack knowledge on how to use Adobe Creative Cloud, but
I greatly look forward to learning more and applying my own style and flair to what I
create as I go.</p>
